# dotfiles

 Linux dotfiles and config files.
 These are configured the way I like them, but they probably aren't configured in the most optimal way.

## Installing

### Basic config (requires emacs & zsh)

 To setup the environment just run this command and follow the prompts:

 ```sh
 curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neboman11/dotfiles/master/setup.sh -o setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
 ```

### Config and install packages

 ```sh
 curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neboman11/dotfiles/master/setup.sh -o setup.sh && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh -i
 ```
